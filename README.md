## My bashrc config

### A few unique things that I run on my .bashrc are:
* My history size is 20000 and I ignore certain multiple words in my history.
* I have several **shopt** options found in bash that make things better like globbing and cdspell which fixes spelling when I spell a dir wrong, just to name a few.
* alias for using .. and ... which will do the same a **cd ..** and **cd ../..** and further.
* alias for my fat-fingering when typing exit.
* alias for gitc and gitp found at lines 171 and 172 which make commiting and push way easier.
* mvg for move and go when changing dirs.
* Neofetch with custom colors painstakingly found after trying each combo one-by-one.
